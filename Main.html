    <h1>All About Dungeons and Dragons</h1>
    <p>How does Dungeons and Dragons work?
        Dungeons & Dragons is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game. It is normally played indoors with the participants seated around a tabletop.
		Typically, one player takes on the role of Dungeon Master (DM) while the others each control a single character, representing an individual in a fictional setting.</p>

        <h3>Lost Mines of Phandelver</h3>
        <p>Probably the best introductory adventure for both new players and new DMs is the Lost of Mine of Phandelver. Even Wizards of the Coast seem to think so, as it's the adventure that comes with their official D&D Starter Set.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-col">
        <h3>Ghosts Of The Saltmarsh</h3>
        <p>Adventures don't just occur on land in Dungeons & Dragons, there are plenty of ones that take players out into the ocean, and Ghosts of Saltmarsh is the best intro to the wonderful watery adventures this game has to offer. Ghosts of Saltmarsh includes many classic adventures from the first edition of D&D, adapted for the rules of 5e.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="home-col">
        <h3>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist</h3>
        <p>For players who are interested in D&D but not all of the more high-fantasy and horror aspects of it, Waterdeep: Dragon Heist is one of the best introduction adventures you can hope for. Set in urban cityscape, players will find themselves having to use their smarts, cunning, and charm to investigate some of the most prominent figures in the city of Waterdeep, without alerting law enforcers.</p>

                    "You are not entering this world in the usual manner, for you are setting forth to be a Dungeon Master. Certainly there are stout fighters, mighty magic-users, wily thieves, and courageous clerics who will make their mark in the magical lands of D&D adventure. You however, are above even the greatest of these, for as DM you are to become the Shaper of the Cosmos. It is you who will give form and content to the all the universe. You will breathe life into the stillness, giving meaning and purpose to all the actions which are to follow."
